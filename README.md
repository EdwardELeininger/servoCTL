# ServoCTL

This is a simple little arduino project, my take on a servo tester.
I figure if I'm not going to use a 555, I might as well do something besides control a servo with a pot.

right now it's got buttons and an OLED. maybe I'll add a current sensor, or a battery monitor... 
or...
I know! blinken lights! 
...wait no, I could still do that with a 555..
